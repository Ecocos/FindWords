REI SDET Homework Problem 

Erich Tinguely 1/25/21

Assumptions
- This program will find ASCII character-based words only
- If no words can be found it should just return an empty array
- Prefix or suffix spaces are ignored
- Any non-alphabet character is ignored (e.g. A-Z and a-z only)
- As implemented, no string length check is performed -- very long strings will take a very long time to process
- Currently exceptions are not caught, such as IOExceptions or MalformedURLExceptions
- Strings are case insensitive, "AB" is the same as "ab"
- the Dictionary.IsEnglishWord() method assumes an English dictionary
